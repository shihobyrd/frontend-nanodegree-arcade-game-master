# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

Building this classic Arcade Game was one of the assignments that I worked on through Udacity to complete Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. A HTML file, a CSS file, 3 JavaScript files, and some images for the game were already provided by Udacity. For this project, it was necessary for me to code mostly in the app.js file to be able to construct the basic functionality in the game.  

## Overview

In the beginning of the game, the player image will be placed on the middle tile of the bottom row. The player is able to move up, down, right, and down by using arrow keys. Also, there are 3 enemies, ladybugs, that are placed on the 3 stone tiles. They show up from the left of the canvas and move right at a constant speed; however, their speeds vary each time they disappear and show up from the left side. The player need to reach the water tile without colliding with the enemies to be able to win the game. When the enemy collides with the player icon or once you win the game, the player icon will be placed back to where it started.

## How to Run

The game will run in any modern browser, by opening the index.html file.

## How to Play

- Move the player with the arrow keys
- If you collide with an enemy, you will be placed back at the start
- If you reach the water, you win, and will be placed back at the start
